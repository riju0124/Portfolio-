# Developer Portfolio (TypeScript)

Hey guys! 👋  
This is my **first website built using TypeScript** — designed specifically for developers who want a modern, clean, and fast portfolio.

You can use this as a starting point for your own developer portfolio.  
It's **fully open source** and you're free to clone, customize, and build on top of it!
